# Raja Malik 

👋 Hi, I’m Raja. I'm a senior/lead engineer at [MagicBox](www.getmagicbox.com) and leading the frontend team for rewriting the frontend with new MicroFrontend and brand new component library. Earlier, I was working as a Principal Engineer wtih [UKG](www.ukg.com) where I created framework to render UI based on JSON input. 

### About Me
