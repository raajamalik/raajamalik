# Raja Malik 

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Raja. I'm a senior fullstack engineer at [MagicBox](www.getmagicbox.com) and leading the team for rewriting the frontend & backend with new MicroFrontend/brand new component library and NodeJS/Express. Earlier, I was working as a Fullstack Engineer wtih [UKG](www.ukg.com) where I created framework to render UI based on JSON input using React/Angular/NodeJS. 

### About Me

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) & [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- üíûÔ∏è I want to develop my own library which makes testing and data setup very trivial. I am working on the Draft, I call it ImposeJS.
